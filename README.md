## User Stories

The back-end section of the project focuses on its administration side and covers a single user story:
- As admin, I want to be able to create, edit and delete users, events, comments, likes, attendance and followers; so that I can have complete control over the content of the application.  If necessary, I can remove any inappropriate content and add my own directly.


## Database

The following models were created to represent the database model structure of the application:

## Validation

### Python Validation

PEP8 was unavailable at the time of creating this project so [Pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) was used instead to continually check all Python code for errors and warnings.
Additonally [PeP8CI] (https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) was also used to validate the code.

## Testing

The following tests were carried out on the app:
1. Manual testing of user stories
2. Automated testing

### Manual testing of user stories

- As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit and delete the users, posts, comments and likes, so that I can have a control over the content of the application and remove any potential inappropriate content

**Test** | **Action** | **Expected Result** | **Actual Result**
-------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -----------------
User | Create, update & delete user | A user can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
User | Change permissions | User permissions can be updated | Works as expected
Profile | Create, update & delete | User profile can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Event | Create, update & delete | A Task can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Comment | Create, update & delete | A comment can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Follower | Create & delete |  A Follow relationship between Users can be created or deleted | Works as expected
Like | Create & delete | A Like can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Attending | Create & delete | An Attending tag can be created or deleted | Works as expected

In addition, only logged in users can:
- Create/Update/Delete Events and Comments.
- Like/Unlike or Attend/Unattend events.
- Follow/ Unfollow other users.

Content can only be updated or deleted by their creators.
