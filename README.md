## User Stories

The back-end section of the project focuses on its administration side and covers a single user story:
- As admin, I want to be able to create, edit and delete users, events, comments, likes, attendance and followers; so that I can have complete control over the content of the application.  If necessary, I can remove any inappropriate content and add my own directly.


## Database

The following models were created to represent the database model structure of the application:

## Validation

### Python Validation

PEP8 was unavailable at the time of creating this project so [Pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) was used instead to continually check all Python code for errors and warnings.
Additonally [PeP8CI] (https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) was also used to validate the code.

## Testing

The following tests were carried out on the app:
1. Manual testing of user stories
2. Automated testing

### Manual testing of user stories

- As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit and delete the users, posts, comments and likes, so that I can have a control over the content of the application and remove any potential inappropriate content

**Test** | **Action** | **Expected Result** | **Actual Result**
-------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -----------------


In addition: events, comments and likes can be created by logged-in users only. Users can only update or delete the content which was created by themselves.
